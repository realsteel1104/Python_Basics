I have developed a series of Python scripts that cover the basics of the language using PyCharm IDE. This initial commit includes foundational concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions. The code is organized and well-commented to facilitate understanding and further development. I am excited to share this project on GitHub to showcase my progress and contribute to the Python programming community. Feel free to modify any part of it to better fit your style!
